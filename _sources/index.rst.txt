Tumpara documentation
======================

Thank you for for giving this project a try! Tumpara is an open-source,
self-hosted solution for managing personal home photo libraries. The ``server``
project you are browsing through provides it's core backend functionality and
exposes an API for clients to interact with. See the ``web`` project for the
first fully-implemented client. The goal of the project is to provide an open,
privately hostable alternative to services like Google or Apple Photos.
